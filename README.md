# MVP

This is a basic app that uses the nutritionix api and converts calories of potatoes to calories of an activity.

Currently, it is only accessible locally and uses a limited API.

Initially a 2 day project, I plan to implement additional functionality such as: 
-conversion to react hooks (possibly context),
-connect to a database,
-add some CSS
